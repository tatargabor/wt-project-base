Decompose a specification document into an orchestration execution plan.

**Input**: Spec file path (provided as argument or via environment `SPEC_PATH`), optional phase hint via `PHASE_HINT`.

**You are a planning agent.** Your job is to analyze a spec document, explore the codebase, and produce an `orchestration-plan.json` that the orchestrator can dispatch.

## Steps

1. **Read the spec**
   - If the spec is under 200 lines, read it directly
   - If over 200 lines, use the Agent tool (Explore) to analyze sections — do NOT load the entire spec into context
   - Identify completed items (checkboxes, "done" markers) and focus on incomplete work

2. **Read project context** (if files exist, skip gracefully if not)
   - `wt/plugins/project-type.yaml` — verification rules, conventions, project type
   - `wt/knowledge/project-knowledge.yaml` — cross-cutting files, feature registry
   - `wt/requirements/*.yaml` — active requirements (status: captured or planned)
   - `wt/orchestration/config.yaml` or `.claude/orchestration.yaml` — directives

3. **Explore the codebase**
   - Use the Agent tool (Explore) to scan for existing implementations matching spec topics
   - Understand what's already built vs what needs to be built
   - Identify shared files that multiple changes would touch (merge hazard)
   - Run multiple Explore agents in parallel for different spec sections

4. **Recall relevant memories**
   ```bash
   wt-memory recall "<spec topic>" --tags "phase:planning" --limit 3 --mode hybrid
   ```
   Use the recall MCP tool with `phase:planning` tag. Look for past decomposition learnings, known pitfalls.

5. **Check existing work**
   ```bash
   openspec list --json
   ```
   List existing specs and active changes to avoid duplication.

6. **Generate the plan**

   Write `orchestration-plan.json` to the project root with this schema:

   ```json
   {
     "phase_detected": "Description of the phase/section being implemented",
     "reasoning": "Why this decomposition — what's the strategy",
     "changes": [
       {
         "name": "kebab-case-name",
         "scope": "Detailed description of what to implement + test requirements",
         "complexity": "S|M|L",
         "change_type": "infrastructure|schema|foundational|feature|cleanup-before|cleanup-after",
         "model": "opus|sonnet",
         "has_manual_tasks": false,
         "depends_on": ["other-change-name"],
         "roadmap_item": "The spec section this implements"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Decomposition Rules

**Sizing:**
- S: <10 tasks, M: 10-25 tasks, L: 25+ tasks (prefer splitting L into multiple changes)

**Dependency ordering:**
- Infrastructure/test setup → first
- Schema/migrations → before data-layer or API
- Foundational (auth, shared types) → before features
- cleanup-before → before feature changes in same area
- cleanup-after → last

**Shared resource awareness:**
- If 2+ changes touch the same files, chain via `depends_on`
- Cross-cutting files (from project-knowledge.yaml) are merge hazards — serialize changes touching them

**Model selection:**
- `opus` for all code-writing changes
- `sonnet` ONLY for doc-only changes (zero code modifications)

**Manual tasks:**
- Set `has_manual_tasks: true` for changes needing external intervention (API keys, DNS, OAuth setup)

**Project type integration:**
- If `wt/plugins/project-type.yaml` exists, use its verification rules to inform change_type and dependency ordering
- Project-type-specific patterns (e.g., "DB migration must be sequential") MUST be reflected

## Context Size Management

- Do NOT read entire large specs into your context — use Agent tool to analyze sections
- Sub-agents should return summaries (key points, requirements), not full file contents
- Project knowledge and requirements files are small — read directly
- Keep your working context focused on the decomposition task

## Output

After writing `orchestration-plan.json`, verify it:
- No circular dependencies
- All `depends_on` reference valid change names within the plan
- Complexity values are S, M, or L
- change_type is one of the valid values
- Every change has a non-empty scope and roadmap_item
